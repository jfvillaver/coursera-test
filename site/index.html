		<p>I graduated from Cuesta College with three associate degrees in Computer Science, Mathematics, and Mathematics and Sciences. To further enhance my knowledge and skills in computer programming, I transferred to CSU Stanislaus to finish my bachelor’s degree in Computer Science. I graduated with an overall GPA of 3.3 and have consistently been on the Dean’s list. During my stay there, I learned about SQL, cryptography, C++, human centered design and artificial intelligence.</p>
		<p>I was hired by the Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) Program as a research intern. I got involved in researching the correlations between sensory components and chemical elements using the WEKA platform. After graduating, I got hired by Experts Exchange as an associate Java developer. I was able to use JRebel, GitHub, JIRA, and other computer programming applications which enhanced the process of working with the team and website. Currently, I am a paid intern with Jayne Wayne Web Design and Branding, where I am learning how to build and maintain websites using WordPress.</p>
